glimmer-shiny
=============

All of my Shiny Apps from glimmer.rstudio.com/benporter/*

These files sat in the following directory:

    /home/benporter/ShinyApps

Where:
- benporter is the username and also part of the path for access the Shiny pages
- ShinyApps is the required directory for Shiny application hosting and is not part of the web site path

For example, the <em>wordcloud</em> app can be accessed via:  

    http://glimmer.rstudio.com/benporter/wordcloud/
