Blessed are the poor in spirit
    for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
4 Blessed are those who mourn
    for they will be comforted
5 Blessed are the meek
    for they will inherit the earth
6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
    for they will be filled
7 Blessed are the merciful
    for they will be shown mercy
8 Blessed are the pure in heart
    for they will see God
9 Blessed are the peacemakers
    for they will be called children of God
10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness
    for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
11 Blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me 12 Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you

Salt and Light

13 You are the salt of the earth But if the salt loses its saltiness how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot

14 You are the light of the world A town built on a hill cannot be hidden 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl Instead they put it on its stand and it gives light to everyone in the house 16 In the same way let your light shine before others that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven

The Fulfillment of the Law

17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them 18 For truly I tell you until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished 19 Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven

Murder

21 You have heard that it was said to the people long ago You shall not murdera and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment 22 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sisterbc will be subject to judgment Again anyone who says to a brother or sister Racad is answerable to the court And anyone who says You fool! will be in danger of the fire of hell

23 Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you 24 leave your gift there in front of the altar First go and be reconciled to them then come and offer your gift

25 Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court Do it while you are still together on the way or your adversary may hand you over to the judge and the judge may hand you over to the officer and you may be thrown into prison 26 Truly I tell you you will not get out until you have paid the last penny

Adultery

27 You have heard that it was said You shall not commit adulterye 28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart 29 If your right eye causes you to stumble gouge it out and throw it away It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell

Divorce

31 It has been said Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorcef 32 But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for sexual immorality makes her the victim of adultery and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery

Oaths

33 Again you have heard that it was said to the people long ago Do not break your oath but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made 34 But I tell you do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven for it is Gods throne 35 or by the earth for it is his footstool or by Jerusalem for it is the city of the Great King 36 And do not swear by your head for you cannot make even one hair white or black 37 All you need to say is simply Yes or No anything beyond this comes from the evil oneg


Eye for Eye

38 You have heard that it was said Eye for eye and tooth for toothh 39 But I tell you do not resist an evil person If anyone slaps you on the right cheek turn to them the other cheek also 40 And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt hand over your coat as well 41 If anyone forces you to go one mile go with them two miles 42 Give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you

Love for Enemies

43 You have heard that it was said Love your neighbori and hate your enemy 44 But I tell you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you 45 that you may be children of your Father in heaven He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous 46 If you love those who love you what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? 47 And if you greet only your own people what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? 48 Be perfect therefore as your heavenly Father is perfect

Giving to the Needy

6 Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them If you do you will have no reward from your Father in heaven

2 So when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by others Truly I tell you they have received their reward in full 3 But when you give to the needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing 4 so that your giving may be in secret Then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you

Prayer

5 And when you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others Truly I tell you they have received their reward in full 6 But when you pray go into your room close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen Then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you 7 And when you pray do not keep on babbling like pagans for they think they will be heard because of their many words 8 Do not be like them for your Father knows what you need before you ask him

9 This then is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven
hallowed be your name
10 your kingdom come
your will be done
    on earth as it is in heaven
11 Give us today our daily bread
12 And forgive us our debts
    as we also have forgiven our debtors
13 And lead us not into temptationj
    but deliver us from the evil onek
14 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you your heavenly Father will also forgive you 15 But if you do not forgive others their sins your Father will not forgive your sins

Fasting

16 When you fast do not look somber as the hypocrites do for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting Truly I tell you they have received their reward in full 17 But when you fast put oil on your head and wash your face 18 so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting but only to your Father who is unseen and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you

Treasures in Heaven

19 Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moths and vermin destroy and where thieves break in and steal 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moths and vermin do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal 21 For where your treasure is there your heart will be also

22 The eye is the lamp of the body If your eyes are healthyl your whole body will be full of light 23 But if your eyes are unhealthym your whole body will be full of darkness If then the light within you is darkness how great is that darkness!

24 No one can serve two masters Either you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other You cannot serve both God and money

Do Not Worry

25 Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear Is not life more than food and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your lifen?

28 And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow They do not labor or spin 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? 31 So do not worry saying What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear? 32 For the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself Each day has enough trouble of its own

Judging Others

7 Do not judge or you too will be judged 2 For in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you

3 Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother Let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye

6 Do not give dogs what is sacred do not throw your pearls to pigs If you do they may trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces

Ask Seek Knock

7 Ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you 8 For everyone who asks receives the one who seeks finds and to the one who knocks the door will be opened

9 Which of you if your son asks for bread will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake? 11 If you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! 12 So in everything do to others what you would have them do to you for this sums up the Law and the Prophets

The Narrow and Wide Gates

13 Enter through the narrow gate For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and many enter through it 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it

True and False Prophets

15 Watch out for false prophets They come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ferocious wolves 16 By their fruit you will recognize them Do people pick grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? 17 Likewise every good tree bears good fruit but a bad tree bears bad fruit 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire 20 Thus by their fruit you will recognize them

True and False Disciples

21 Not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven 22 Many will say to me on that day Lord Lord did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles? 23 Then I will tell them plainly I never knew you Away from me you evildoers!

The Wise and Foolish Builders

24 Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock 25 The rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall because it had its foundation on the rock 26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand 27 The rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash
